# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project was made to help Louise with her crowdfunding campaign to fund *fever*. and the best way to start, is analyzing the information of previous campaignsAnd create scenarios with future campaigns.  

## Purpose
The purpose was to determine when and where she could start the campaign and to have an idea of the amount that could be collected. 
Louise was mainly interested in the results of United States campaigns and Great Britain campaigns. we could reduce the amount of data necessary to separate the campaigns by goals, outcomes, dates and play with them a little to find the data necessary to create pivot table, charts (making it easier to digest) and remove the outliers to get a data more precise  


## Analysis and Challenges
### The analysis was performed in multiple steps:
        1.	#### Analyzing Data: Help us to familiarize with the information.

        2.	#### Filtering Data: That Way we could divide the data and then create more columns or copy the data to new worksheets.
        using filters located on the data tab. 
        3.	#### Found the Average Between Campaigns: Using the information gather in campaigns like “successful and failed” was able to dissect it even more to                    the point that we could know when was the best months to release the campaigns in order to collect more money.

        4.	#### Creating Visual Aids: With the information gather we create charts (bar and line), pivot tables and to show large amount of information in a                      small area to make more practical.
        using conditional formating bar charts, line charts, pivot charts
         
        5.	###Using Tools to Find the Tendencies: We found the data that could affect our calculations and put them aside.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
####The worse time to launch a campaign is close to the holydays.
####May is the best month to launch the campaign in the theater category.
####Music had more successful outcomes all year long among the other categories.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
####Successful goals doubled in number the failed ones.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####The challenge for me was: the correct use of the formulas, because just one character changed the results multiple and in the long run when I realized the I had a bigger problem. Using the modules information. Some YouTube videos and some websides could overcome those problems the good thing is that I could reverse the data to the root. 

## Results

###- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
####60% of the campaings filtered was succesful
#### the sum of live and canceled campaings reached just 4%

###- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
no canceled campaings found with that criteria

###- What are some limitations of this dataset?
####Too many different currency and makes it more complicated to gather information if a column with the money spend yearly in campaigns 

###- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
####graph line with the years on each country showing the progress of each subcategory with the time
